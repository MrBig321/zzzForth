The standard blending equation is:

out = alpha * new + (1 - alpha) * old

Where out, new and old are RGB colors, and alpha is a floating point number in the range [0,1].

So, you have (for red):

240 = 0.1 * newR + 0.9 * 255

Solving for newR, we get:

newR = (240 - 0.9 * 255) / 0.1

which evaluates to 105. Repeat for the other components, and you're done.


*****The same but put it differently:
opacity*original + (1-opacity)*background = resulting pixel

original R = (resulting R - ((1-opacity)*background R)) / opacity.
original G = (resulting G - ((1-opacity)*background G)) / opacity.
original B = (resulting B - ((1-opacity)*background B)) / opacity.

in which opacity is (alpha/100).
