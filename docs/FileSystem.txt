; FileSystem was written in assembly, but was removed from ZFOS.
; It was a modified FAT32

1.  FSFORMAT .  ( formats HD, updates hdfsmbr(hdfsmbrbytes) and hdfsboot(hdfsbootbytes), then writes them to disk (HD).
2.  FSINIT .
3.  Copy HDFSLODR.SYS and KRNL.SYS from pendrive to HD as "LODR.SYS" and "KRNL.SYS". 
        (HDFSLODR.SYS writes in 16-bit mode a signature (a DWORD) for kernel.asm)
4.  Load files to memory from pendrive (USB)
5.  Write them to HD: 
        HEX
        20000000 sizeinbytes FSWRITE LODR.SYS" .
        FALSE FSLS .
        ( Load Kernel-file to memory)
        20000000 sizeinbytes FSWRITE KRNL.SYS" .
6. In Bochs or QEMU select boot from HD
