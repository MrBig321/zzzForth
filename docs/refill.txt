Blocks:
1.  1 LIST
2.  Enter code of BIGF (At the end "0 BLK !")
3.  F6 (Update)
4.  Esc
5.  SAVE-BUFFERS
6.  In Cmd-Line: "1 BLK !"

We can use several blocks this way, but in the last one (or in the one that uses LOAD) have the line "0 BLK !" to stop REFILL.
Problem: as many "ok" in Cmd-Line as many blocks get loaded.
