( The HDAudio driver worked on Dell D820 and an old desktop computer.
I also tested it on Dell Inspiron 5559 and Eee PC 1001PX.
; FEATURES
;	- Uses the first codec found
;	- Output only
;	- Short list-entries only (parsing 2 DWORDS, i.e. max 8 ConnListEntries for a node)
;	- (Range)	Not implemented yet
;	- Sets volume to medium (gain = 0x3F) (0x7F is the maximum)
;	- DEBUGPARSE defined: prints parse-paths
;	- DEBUG_SETTINGS prints the values of the widgets after we set them
;	- I couldn't test the Knob-widget 

AUCODECSINFO prints data about codec, widgets (e.g. widget-capabilities), 
it can be executed right after boot, if HDAUDIO was successfully detected.

AUINFO prints the values of the registers and the DMA-positions. 
It is useful to see if the DMA-engines are looping or not (constantly changing value in case of every AUINFO).
This is true, if we execute AUINFO during audio-play.
Note that only 8 positions get printed, so if there are 7 input-streams and 9 output streams, then 
the last one will show the DMA-position of the first output-stream.
If there are 4 input-streams and 4 output-streams then the 5th value will be the first output-stream's.
