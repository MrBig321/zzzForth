Booting from floppy is the active one by default (the files in boot/floppy were copied to ZFOS and ZFOS/boot), so we just need to execute buildAll2.sh in the ZFOS folder:
	./buildAll2.sh
Note that it uses python3.
BOCHS:
The configuration file for Bochs is in the ZFOS/boot/floppy folder: bochsrc.txt. Rename it to ".bochsrc" (without the quotes) and copy it to our home.
Execute bochs from our home folder:
	bochs
Both USB(EHCI) and USB(XHCI) works with Bochs.

QEMU:
It has no configuration file.
I usually start it like this:
qemu-system-x86_64 -fda file.img -m 2G -hda qhd.img -drive if=none,id=usbstick,file=pd.img -usb -device usb-ehci,id=ehci -device usb-storage,bus=ehci.0,drive=usbstick -boot menu=on -enable-kvm
file.img is the output of the floppy-build of ZFOS.
qhd.img can be created with qemu-img.
Only USB(EHCI) works with QEMU.
I managed to get USB-passthrough too working with QEMU.
